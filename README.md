User/Group Profile Information

The profile info page is created for users to view their own profile. Other users and guests can view your profile page
to find similar interests and groups requests.
 
The profile page includes the following:

* User's information - small bio, profile picture
* Status posts - posts created from the user or from groups joined
* pictures - upload pictures and create an album
* list of interests - based off evaluation from the questionnaire or from the registration page
* list of groups - the number of groups the user joined
* list of friends - add/remove/block friends; others users can add you via user profile 
* group schedule events - view events listed from differents groups you've joined

Current things I'm working on:

* Create additional databases for other functions (interests, comment posts, groups, friends)
* Continue sanitization for the page
* Add any final adjustments to modify the page

Notes:
* Instead of putting too many php codes, the php function 'comments.inc.php' will handle all the functions instead.
