Rebuilding social media app from scratch using NodeJS as backend server, MySQL as database (same as before), and ReactJS for front end, and Bootstrap 5 for styling.

There are two directories, /backend and /app.

They both depend on npm, Node Package Manager.
Have that installed in your system.

From /app, run
    npm install

from /backend, run
    npm install

    /backend will need a .env folder (do not track with Github)

    here, you'll add your MySQL credentials for:
        host, user, password, database

you'll need to set up a MySQL server and execute the contents of /sql.
