User/Group Profile Information

The profile info page is created for users to view their own profile. Other users and guests can view your profile page
to find similar interests and groups requests.
 
The profile page includes the following:

* User's information - small bio, profile picture
* Status posts - posts created from the user or from groups joined
* pictures - upload pictures and create an album
* list of interests - based off evaluation from the questionnaire or from the registration page
* list of groups - the number of groups the user joined
* list of friends - add/remove/block friends; others users can add you via user profile 
* group schedule events - view events listed from differents groups you've joined

Current things I'm working on:

* Create connection 'connection.php'
* Create sql database for posts, comments, and friends
* Create sanitization for the main page
* Add functionality to the page (php, sql, etc.)

Sign up form and log in forms have been added to master branch. They work with the MySQL database tables in sql/socialmedia.sql

Group members: make sure to update your current branches by pulling these master branch changes. I don't think any of my work should
                interfere with what you've got, so everything should go smoothly. Also, when you have a significant amount of work 
                done on your branch and you want to add that content to the master branch, let me know on Discord after some testing 
                has been done on it and I'll merge it and add it to the master branch. If you guys need any help with anything you may be 
                stuck on, let me know! I'm more than glad to help! We can work through Zoom or Discord, if need be. If you need someone to 
                discuss implemenation ideas for a story/feature or get a second opinion, I'm glad to help also!
